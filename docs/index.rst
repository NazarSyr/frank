Documentation
=============

Welcome to the Frankenstein (:py:mod:`frank`) documentation. The :py:mod:`frank`
code package is used to fit the 1D radial brightness profile of an
interferometric source given a set of visibilities. This site details how to
install and run the code, provides examples for applying the model and
interpreting its results, and hosts the code's API.
